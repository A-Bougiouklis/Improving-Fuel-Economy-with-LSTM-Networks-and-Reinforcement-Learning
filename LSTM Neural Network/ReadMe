The LSTM NN consumption model uses elevation, E(n), and velocity, V(n),
sequences as inputs. The output is the consumed phase current of the electric
motor, I(n). For the hidden layers we chose LSTM units with a sigmoid activation
function. Finally, the output layer is a fully connected node.
The selected architecture has 50 LSTM nodes in the first layer and 35 LSTM
nodes in the second. We concluded to this particular layout by examining all the
combinations of nodes between 0 and 100 for a two layer NN. This architecture
minimizes the mean square error of the training process.
The data acquired from the telemetry system is first passed through a clean-
ing process. In this stage, we remove data corresponding to negative phase cur-
rent values. These are invalid elements as the vehicle does not have regenerative
braking and the phase current is always positive. Also, zero latitude and longi-
tude measurements are removed. The zero values correspond to loss of signal on
the GPS sensor. At a 50Hz sampling rate the percentage of the removed values
is signicantly smaller than the size of the training set and therefore we did not
alter the sequence of the data.
The inputs fed into the network are sequences of 300 elements each and the
output is the sum of the consumed phase current from these measurements.
The training process was conducted with a training data set of 658.500 mea-
surements which correspond to 13 laps from the eco-marathon 2016 and 9 rounds
from the eco-marathon 2017. The validation set consisted of 36.000 elements from
1 lap on the 2017 track.
The neural network was implemented with the KERAS library. We used the
RMSprop optimizer and early stopping with the patience parameter set to 13
epochs. Finally, the learning rate was set to 0.001. After training, the mean
squared error was 0.3972.
