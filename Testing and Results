The presented system has been installed on the Light Electrical Vehicle. To test the results of the system and the behavior of the 
driver when the system is running we conducted the following experiment during the Europe Shell Eco Marathon event 2017.
First, we asked the driver to maintain a constant velocity on the closed track mentioned above, which is 1.7 kilometers in length, as a
regular cruise control system would do. Second, we used the suggested system and the driver tried to follow the optimum 
trajectory while driving with the same desired average velocity. The experiment showed that by adopting the suggested driving
strategy the total consumption was reduced by 24.03%.

Graph 1 shows the generated power from the engine of the LEV when the driver maintains a constant velocity of 25km/h in the testing track.
Graph 2 shows the generated power when the driver uses the system with the chosen velocity profile and the chosen racing line.
