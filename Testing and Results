The presented system has been installed on the Light Electrical Vehicle. To
test the results of the system and the behavior of the driver when the system
is running we conducted the following experiment during the Europe Shell Eco
Marathon event 2017. First, we asked the driver to maintain a constant velocity
on the closed track mentioned above, which is 1.7 kilometers in length, as a
regular cruise control system would do. Second, we used the suggested system
and the driver tried to follow the optimum trajectory while driving with the
same desired average velocity. The experiment showed that by adopting the suggested driving
strategy the total consumption was reduced by 24.03%.
