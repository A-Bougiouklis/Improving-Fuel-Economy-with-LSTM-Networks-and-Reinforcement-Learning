The Preprocess_Track_Data. py uses functions which are explained in the preprocess for the NN. 
Here the program keeps only one lap and then organize the data in the correct structure in order to be used for the NN. 
Also, it finds the end of each slot, the end of each state of the environment.
The data are used after in the Q-Learning algorithm in order to approximate the optimal velocities for the vehicle.
